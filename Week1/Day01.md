Day 1 - Introduction to Cyber Security
keylearnings
1.Offensive security - where we act as hackers and find vulnerabilities and try to exploit them before actual hackers can take advantage of it.PEN tester and RED team come under this

2.Defensive security - here we prevent intrusions from occuring and detecting intrusions when happen and respend properly - Blue team comes under this.

=>Tasks realted to defensive security- *User cyber security awareness *Documaneting and managing assets *Updating and patching systems *setting up preventive security devices(uses firewalls(controls network traffic i.e., what network traffic can come inside and go outside) and Intrusion prevention systems(IPS)(IPS blocks any network traffics that matches present rules and attack signatires)) *setting up proper logging and monitoring devices

=>Security Operations Center(SOC) - They monitor the netwroks amd systems for malicious cyber security events Areas od interests of SOC are: *Vulnerabilities(when they find vul they should fix it by installing a proper update or patch) *policy violations *Unauthorized activity(if they find such activity they must detect and block it before further damage is done) *Network Intrusions There are many such tasks SOC do to ensure protection , one such is Threat intelligence(trying to know your target and collect their info to know thier next move or how to respend to their moves to migitate their attacks and prepare a response stratery)

Digital forensics and incident response -digital forensics is analysisng eveidence of an attack(focuses on file system, system memory, memory logs, network logs) -incident response (intrusion attempts. policy violations or defacing the public web site and many more , incident responce specifies to handle such cases by preparation, detection and analysis,(containment, eradication and recovery), post-incident activity Malware analysis(static and dynamic analysis)
