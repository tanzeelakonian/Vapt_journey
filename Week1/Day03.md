A:star,bus,ring
what is very hard to maintain but s=useful topology?
star
what is way where everydata packets travels in bus topology?
connecting main wire is called as bacbone
what is very unefficient topology?
bus topology i think
what is switch?

What is ARP?
Address resolution protocol, which helps identify mac address using ip addresses.it will keep the log of mac address of  other devices
how Arp works?
to map mac and IP adress together there are two requests, ARP request and ARP Reply.when an ARP request a message is broadcated on the network like what is the mac address of this ip adress, the device with same ip address will send its mac address with ARP reply message, and device that requested can store this mac address in ARP cache
What IS DHCP?
Digital hist configuration protocol, if any device is new to network it will ask if there is any DGCP near by as DHCP DISCOVER messgae , id any DHCP is near it reponds with a new IP address as DHCP OFFER , then That device takes that IP address and sends a DHCP REQUEST TO dhcp, then DHCP send an ancknowledgement as DHCP ACK.
